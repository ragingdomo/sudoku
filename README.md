# sudoku
Based on a research project from college, this app is designed to use a genetic algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles. The original research paper only described the solution in plain text and referenced functions and classes, but never showed any actual code. I attempted to rebuild their program only by inferring details from the paper. The program is nearly complete, I just got stuck on iterating through a sudoku board. The rest of the logic works perfectly.
